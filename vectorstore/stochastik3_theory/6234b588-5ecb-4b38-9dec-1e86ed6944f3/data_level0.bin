        Notes
        -----
        .. versionchanged:: 2.0.0

            Using ``astype`` to convert from timezone-naive dtype to
            timezone-aware dtype will raise an exception.
            Use :meth:`Series.dt.tz_localize` instead.

        Examples
        --------
        Create a DataFrame:

        >>> d = {'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': [3, 4]}
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data=d)
        >>> df.dtypes
        col1    int64
        col2    int64
        dtype: object

        Cast all columns to int32:

        >>> df.astype('int32').dtypes
        col1    int32
        col2    int32
        dtype: object

        Cast col1 to int32 using a dictionary:

        >>> df.astype({'col1': 'int32'}).dtypes
        col1    int32
        col2    int64
        dtype: object

        Create a series:

        >>> ser = pd.Series([1, 2], dtype='int32')
        >>> ser
        0    1
        1    2
        dtype: int32
        >>> ser.astype('int64')
        0    1
        1    2
        dtype: int64

        Convert to categorical type:

        >>> ser.astype('category')
        0    1
        1    2
        dtype: category
        Categories (2, int32): [1, 2]

        Convert to ordered categorical type with custom ordering:

        >>> from pandas.api.types import CategoricalDtype
        >>> cat_dtype = CategoricalDtype(
        ...     categories=[2, 1], ordered=True)
        >>> ser.astype(cat_dtype)
        0    1
        1    2
        dtype: category
        Categories (2, int64): [2 < 1]

        Create a series of dates:

        >>> ser_date = pd.Series(pd.date_range('20200101', periods=3))
        >>> ser_date
        0   2020-01-01
        1   2020-01-02
        2   2020-01-03

        Make a copy of this object's indices and data.

        When ``deep=True`` (default), a new object will be created with a
        copy of the calling object's data and indices. Modifications to
        the data or indices of the copy will not be reflected in the
        original object (see notes below).

        When ``deep=False``, a new object will be created without copying
        the calling object's data or index (only references to the data
        and index are copied). Any changes to the data of the original
        will be reflected in the shallow copy (and vice versa).

        .. note::
            The ``deep=False`` behaviour as described above will change
            in pandas 3.0. `Copy-on-Write
            <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/user_guide/copy_on_write.html>`__
            will be enabled by default, which means that the "shallow" copy
            is that is returned with ``deep=False`` will still avoid making
            an eager copy, but changes to the data of the original will *no*
            longer be reflected in the shallow copy (or vice versa). Instead,
            it makes use of a lazy (deferred) copy mechanism that will copy
            the data only when any changes to the original or shallow copy is
            made.

            You can already get the future behavior and improvements through
            enabling copy on write ``pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = True``

        Parameters
        ----------
        deep : bool, default True
            Make a deep copy, including a copy of the data and the indices.
            With ``deep=False`` neither the indices nor the data are copied.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame
            Object type matches caller.

        Notes
        -----
        When ``deep=True``, data is copied but actual Python objects
        will not be copied recursively, only the reference to the object.
        This is in contrast to `copy.deepcopy` in the Standard Library,
        which recursively copies object data (see examples below).

        While ``Index`` objects are copied when ``deep=True``, the underlying
        numpy array is not copied for performance reasons. Since ``Index`` is
        immutable, the underlying data can be safely shared and a copy
        is not needed.

        Since pandas is not thread safe, see the
        :ref:`gotchas <gotchas.thread-safety>` when copying in a threading
        environment.

        When ``copy_on_write`` in pandas config is set to ``True``, the
        ``copy_on_write`` config takes effect even when ``deep=False``.
        This means that any changes to the copied data would make a new copy
        of the data upon write (and vice versa). Changes made to either the
        original or copied variable would not be reflected in the counterpart.
        See :ref:`Copy_on_Write <copy_on_write>` for more information.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> s = pd.Series([1, 2], index=["a", "b"])
        >>> s
        a    1
        b    2
        dtype: int64

        >>> s_copy = s.copy()
        >>> s_copy
        a    1
        b    2
        dtype: int64

        **Shallow copy versus default (deep) copy:**

        >>> s = pd.Series([1, 2], index=["a", "b"])
        >>> deep = s.copy()
        >>> shallow = s.copy(deep=False)

        Shallow copy shares data and index with original.

        >>> s is shallow
        False
        >>> s.values is shallow.values and s.index is shallow.index
        True

        Deep copy has own copy of data and index.

        >>> s is deep
        False
        >>> s.values is deep.values or s.index is deep.index
        False

        Updates to the data shared by shallow copy and original is reflected
        in both (NOTE: this will no longer be true for pandas >= 3.0);
        deep copy remains unchanged.

        >>> s.iloc[0] = 3
        >>> shallow.iloc[1] = 4
        >>> s
        a    3
        b    4
        dtype: int64
        >>> shallow
        a    3
        b    4
        dtype: int64
        >>> deep
        a    1
        b    2
        dtype: int64

        Note that when copying an object containing Python objects, a deep copy
        will copy the data, but will not do so recursively. Updating a nested
        data object will be reflected in the deep copy.

        >>> s = pd.Series([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
        >>> deep = s.copy()
        >>> s[0][0] = 10
        >>> s
        0    [10, 2]
        1     [3, 4]
        dtype: object
        >>> deep
        0    [10, 2]
        1     [3, 4]
        dtype: object

        **Copy-on-Write is set to true**, the shallow copy is not modified
        when the original data is changed:

        >>> with pd.option_context("mode.copy_on_write", True):
        ...     s = pd.Series([1, 2], index=["a", "b"])
        ...     copy = s.copy(deep=False)
        ...     s.iloc[0] = 100
        ...     s
        a    100
        b      2
        dtype: int64
        >>> copy
        a    1
        b    2
        dtype: int64

        Attempt to infer better dtypes for object columns.

        Attempts soft conversion of object-dtyped
        columns, leaving non-object and unconvertible
        columns unchanged. The inference rules are the
        same as during normal Series/DataFrame construction.

        Parameters
        ----------
        copy : bool, default True
            Whether to make a copy for non-object or non-inferable columns
            or Series.

            .. note::
                The `copy` keyword will change behavior in pandas 3.0.
                `Copy-on-Write
                <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/user_guide/copy_on_write.html>`__
                will be enabled by default, which means that all methods with a
                `copy` keyword will use a lazy copy mechanism to defer the copy and
                ignore the `copy` keyword. The `copy` keyword will be removed in a
                future version of pandas.

                You can already get the future behavior and improvements through
                enabling copy on write ``pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = True``

        -------
        same type as input object

        Convert columns to the best possible dtypes using dtypes supporting ``pd.NA``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        infer_objects : bool, default True
            Whether object dtypes should be converted to the best possible types.
        convert_string : bool, default True
            Whether object dtypes should be converted to ``StringDtype()``.
        convert_integer : bool, default True
            Whether, if possible, conversion can be done to integer extension types.
        convert_boolean : bool, defaults True
            Whether object dtypes should be converted to ``BooleanDtypes()``.
        convert_floating : bool, defaults True
            Whether, if possible, conversion can be done to floating extension types.
            If `convert_integer` is also True, preference will be give to integer
            dtypes if the floats can be faithfully casted to integers.
        dtype_backend : {'numpy_nullable', 'pyarrow'}, default 'numpy_nullable'
            Back-end data type applied to the resultant :class:`DataFrame`
            (still experimental). Behaviour is as follows:

            * ``"numpy_nullable"``: returns nullable-dtype-backed :class:`DataFrame`
              (default).
            * ``"pyarrow"``: returns pyarrow-backed nullable :class:`ArrowDtype`
              DataFrame.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame
            Copy of input object with new dtype.

        See Also
        --------
        infer_objects : Infer dtypes of objects.
        to_datetime : Convert argument to datetime.
        to_timedelta : Convert argument to timedelta.
        to_numeric : Convert argument to a numeric type.

        Notes
        -----
        By default, ``convert_dtypes`` will attempt to convert a Series (or each
        Series in a DataFrame) to dtypes that support ``pd.NA``. By using the options
        ``convert_string``, ``convert_integer``, ``convert_boolean`` and
        ``convert_floating``, it is possible to turn off individual conversions
        to ``StringDtype``, the integer extension types, ``BooleanDtype``
        or floating extension types, respectively.

        For object-dtyped columns, if ``infer_objects`` is ``True``, use the inference
        rules as during normal Series/DataFrame construction.  Then, if possible,
        convert to ``StringDtype``, ``BooleanDtype`` or an appropriate integer
        or floating extension type, otherwise leave as ``object``.

        If the dtype is integer, convert to an appropriate integer extension type.

        If the dtype is numeric, and consists of all integers, convert to an
        appropriate integer extension type. Otherwise, convert to an
        appropriate floating extension type.

        In the future, as new dtypes are added that support ``pd.NA``, the results
        of this method will change to support those new dtypes.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(
        ...     {
        ...         "a": pd.Series([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.dtype("int32")),
        ...         "b": pd.Series(["x", "y", "z"], dtype=np.dtype("O")),
        ...         "c": pd.Series([True, False, np.nan], dtype=np.dtype("O")),
        ...         "d": pd.Series(["h", "i", np.nan], dtype=np.dtype("O")),
        ...         "e": pd.Series([10, np.nan, 20], dtype=np.dtype("float")),
        ...         "f": pd.Series([np.nan, 100.5, 200], dtype=np.dtype("float")),
        ...     }
        ... )

        Start with a DataFrame with default dtypes.

        >>> df
           a  b      c    d     e      f
        0  1  x   True    h  10.0    NaN
        1  2  y  False    i   NaN  100.5
        2  3  z    NaN  NaN  20.0  200.0

        >>> df.dtypes
        a      int32
        b     object
        c     object
        d     object
        e    float64
        f    float64
        dtype: object

        Convert the DataFrame to use best possible dtypes.

        >>> dfn = df.convert_dtypes()
        >>> dfn
           a  b      c     d     e      f
        0  1  x   True     h    10   <NA>
        1  2  y  False     i  <NA>  100.5
        2  3  z   <NA>  <NA>    20  200.0

        >>> dfn.dtypes
        a             Int32
        b    string[python]
        c           boolean
        d    string[python]
        e             Int64
        f           Float64
        dtype: object

        Start with a Series of strings and missing data represented by ``np.nan``.

        >>> s = pd.Series(["a", "b", np.nan])
        >>> s
        0      a
        1      b
        2    NaN
        dtype: object

        Obtain a Series with dtype ``StringDtype``.

        >>> s.convert_dtypes()
        0       a
        1       b
        2    <NA>

        Fill NA/NaN values using the specified method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        value : scalar, dict, Series, or DataFrame
            Value to use to fill holes (e.g. 0), alternately a
            dict/Series/DataFrame of values specifying which value to use for
            each index (for a Series) or column (for a DataFrame).  Values not
            in the dict/Series/DataFrame will not be filled. This value cannot
            be a list.
        method : {{'backfill', 'bfill', 'ffill', None}}, default None
            Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series:

            * ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid.
            * backfill / bfill: use next valid observation to fill gap.

            .. deprecated:: 2.1.0
                Use ffill or bfill instead.

        axis : {axes_single_arg}
            Axis along which to fill missing values. For `Series`
            this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.
        inplace : bool, default False
            If True, fill in-place. Note: this will modify any
            other views on this object (e.g., a no-copy slice for a column in a
            DataFrame).
        limit : int, default None
            If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
            NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
            a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
            be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
            maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
            filled. Must be greater than 0 if not None.
        downcast : dict, default is None
            A dict of item->dtype of what to downcast if possible,
            or the string 'infer' which will try to downcast to an appropriate
            equal type (e.g. float64 to int64 if possible).

            .. deprecated:: 2.2.0

        Returns
        -------
        {klass} or None
            Object with missing values filled or None if ``inplace=True``.

        See Also
        --------
        ffill : Fill values by propagating the last valid observation to next valid.
        bfill : Fill values by using the next valid observation to fill the gap.
        interpolate : Fill NaN values using interpolation.
        reindex : Conform object to new index.
        asfreq : Convert TimeSeries to specified frequency.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame([[np.nan, 2, np.nan, 0],
        ...                    [3, 4, np.nan, 1],
        ...                    [np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan],
        ...                    [np.nan, 3, np.nan, 4]],
        ...                   columns=list("ABCD"))
        >>> df
             A    B   C    D
        0  NaN  2.0 NaN  0.0
        1  3.0  4.0 NaN  1.0
        2  NaN  NaN NaN  NaN
        3  NaN  3.0 NaN  4.0

        Replace all NaN elements with 0s.

        >>> df.fillna(0)
             A    B    C    D
        0  0.0  2.0  0.0  0.0
        1  3.0  4.0  0.0  1.0
        2  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
        3  0.0  3.0  0.0  4.0

        Replace all NaN elements in column 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D', with 0, 1,
        2, and 3 respectively.

        >>> values = {{"A": 0, "B": 1, "C": 2, "D": 3}}
        >>> df.fillna(value=values)
             A    B    C    D
        0  0.0  2.0  2.0  0.0
        1  3.0  4.0  2.0  1.0
        2  0.0  1.0  2.0  3.0
        3  0.0  3.0  2.0  4.0

        Only replace the first NaN element.

        >>> df.fillna(value=values, limit=1)
             A    B    C    D
        0  0.0  2.0  2.0  0.0
        1  3.0  4.0  NaN  1.0
        2  NaN  1.0  NaN  3.0
        3  NaN  3.0  NaN  4.0

        When filling using a DataFrame, replacement happens along
        the same column names and same indices

        >>> df2 = pd.DataFrame(np.zeros((4, 4)), columns=list("ABCE"))
        >>> df.fillna(df2)
             A    B    C    D
        0  0.0  2.0  0.0  0.0
        1  3.0  4.0  0.0  1.0
        2  0.0  0.0  0.0  NaN
        3  0.0  3.0  0.0  4.0

        Note that column D is not affected since it is not present in df2.

        Fill NA/NaN values by propagating the last valid observation to next valid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : {axes_single_arg}
            Axis along which to fill missing values. For `Series`
            this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.
        inplace : bool, default False
            If True, fill in-place. Note: this will modify any
            other views on this object (e.g., a no-copy slice for a column in a
            DataFrame).
        limit : int, default None
            If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
            NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
            a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
            be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
            maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
            filled. Must be greater than 0 if not None.
        limit_area : {{`None`, 'inside', 'outside'}}, default None
            If limit is specified, consecutive NaNs will be filled with this
            restriction.

            * ``None``: No fill restriction.
            * 'inside': Only fill NaNs surrounded by valid values
              (interpolate).
            * 'outside': Only fill NaNs outside valid values (extrapolate).

            .. versionadded:: 2.2.0

        downcast : dict, default is None
            A dict of item->dtype of what to downcast if possible,
            or the string 'infer' which will try to downcast to an appropriate
            equal type (e.g. float64 to int64 if possible).

            .. deprecated:: 2.2.0

        Returns
        -------
        {klass} or None

        Fill NaN values using an interpolation method.

        Please note that only ``method='linear'`` is supported for
        DataFrame/Series with a MultiIndex.

        Parameters
        ----------
        method : str, default 'linear'
            Interpolation technique to use. One of:

            * 'linear': Ignore the index and treat the values as equally
              spaced. This is the only method supported on MultiIndexes.
            * 'time': Works on daily and higher resolution data to interpolate
              given length of interval.
            * 'index', 'values': use the actual numerical values of the index.
            * 'pad': Fill in NaNs using existing values.
            * 'nearest', 'zero', 'slinear', 'quadratic', 'cubic',
              'barycentric', 'polynomial': Passed to
              `scipy.interpolate.interp1d`, whereas 'spline' is passed to
              `scipy.interpolate.UnivariateSpline`. These methods use the numerical
              values of the index.  Both 'polynomial' and 'spline' require that
              you also specify an `order` (int), e.g.
              ``df.interpolate(method='polynomial', order=5)``. Note that,
              `slinear` method in Pandas refers to the Scipy first order `spline`
              instead of Pandas first order `spline`.
            * 'krogh', 'piecewise_polynomial', 'spline', 'pchip', 'akima',
              'cubicspline': Wrappers around the SciPy interpolation methods of
              similar names. See `Notes`.
            * 'from_derivatives': Refers to
              `scipy.interpolate.BPoly.from_derivatives`.

        axis : {{0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns', None}}, default None
            Axis to interpolate along. For `Series` this parameter is unused
            and defaults to 0.
        limit : int, optional
            Maximum number of consecutive NaNs to fill. Must be greater than
            0.
        inplace : bool, default False
            Update the data in place if possible.
        limit_direction : {{'forward', 'backward', 'both'}}, Optional
            Consecutive NaNs will be filled in this direction.

            If limit is specified:
                * If 'method' is 'pad' or 'ffill', 'limit_direction' must be 'forward'.
                * If 'method' is 'backfill' or 'bfill', 'limit_direction' must be
                  'backwards'.

            If 'limit' is not specified:
                * If 'method' is 'backfill' or 'bfill', the default is 'backward'
                * else the default is 'forward'

            raises ValueError if `limit_direction` is 'forward' or 'both' and
                method is 'backfill' or 'bfill'.
            raises ValueError if `limit_direction` is 'backward' or 'both' and
                method is 'pad' or 'ffill'.

        limit_area : {{`None`, 'inside', 'outside'}}, default None
            If limit is specified, consecutive NaNs will be filled with this
            restriction.

            * ``None``: No fill restriction.
            * 'inside': Only fill NaNs surrounded by valid values
              (interpolate).
            * 'outside': Only fill NaNs outside valid values (extrapolate).

        downcast : optional, 'infer' or None, defaults to None
            Downcast dtypes if possible.

            .. deprecated:: 2.1.0

        ``**kwargs`` : optional
            Keyword arguments to pass on to the interpolating function.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame or None
            Returns the same object type as the caller, interpolated at
            some or all ``NaN`` values or None if ``inplace=True``.

        See Also
        --------
        fillna : Fill missing values using different methods.
        scipy.interpolate.Akima1DInterpolator : Piecewise cubic polynomials
            (Akima interpolator).
        scipy.interpolate.BPoly.from_derivatives : Piecewise polynomial in the
            Bernstein basis.

        Notes
        -----
        The 'krogh', 'piecewise_polynomial', 'spline', 'pchip' and 'akima'
        methods are wrappers around the respective SciPy implementations of
        similar names. These use the actual numerical values of the index.
        For more information on their behavior, see the
        `SciPy documentation
        <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html#univariate-interpolation>`__.

        Examples
        --------
        Filling in ``NaN`` in a :class:`~pandas.Series` via linear
        interpolation.

        >>> s = pd.Series([0, 1, np.nan, 3])
        >>> s
        0    0.0
        1    1.0
        2    NaN
        3    3.0
        dtype: float64
        >>> s.interpolate()
        0    0.0
        1    1.0
        2    2.0
        3    3.0
        dtype: float64

        Filling in ``NaN`` in a Series via polynomial interpolation or splines:
        Both 'polynomial' and 'spline' methods require that you also specify
        an ``order`` (int).

        >>> s = pd.Series([0, 2, np.nan, 8])
        >>> s.interpolate(method='polynomial', order=2)
        0    0.000000
        1    2.000000
        2    4.666667
        3    8.000000
        dtype: float64

        Fill the DataFrame forward (that is, going down) along each column
        using linear interpolation.

        Note how the last entry in column 'a' is interpolated differently,
        because there is no entry after it to use for interpolation.
        Note how the first entry in column 'b' remains ``NaN``, because there
        is no entry before it to use for interpolation.

        >>> df = pd.DataFrame([(0.0, np.nan, -1.0, 1.0),
        ...                    (np.nan, 2.0, np.nan, np.nan),
        ...                    (2.0, 3.0, np.nan, 9.0),
        ...                    (np.nan, 4.0, -4.0, 16.0)],
        ...                   columns=list('abcd'))
        >>> df
             a    b    c     d
        0  0.0  NaN -1.0   1.0
        1  NaN  2.0  NaN   NaN
        2  2.0  3.0  NaN   9.0
        3  NaN  4.0 -4.0  16.0
        >>> df.interpolate(method='linear', limit_direction='forward', axis=0)
             a    b    c     d
        0  0.0  NaN -1.0   1.0
        1  1.0  2.0 -2.0   5.0
        2  2.0  3.0 -3.0   9.0

        Return the last row(s) without any NaNs before `where`.

        The last row (for each element in `where`, if list) without any
        NaN is taken.
        In case of a :class:`~pandas.DataFrame`, the last row without NaN
        considering only the subset of columns (if not `None`)

        If there is no good value, NaN is returned for a Series or
        a Series of NaN values for a DataFrame

        Parameters
        ----------
        where : date or array-like of dates
            Date(s) before which the last row(s) are returned.
        subset : str or array-like of str, default `None`
            For DataFrame, if not `None`, only use these columns to
            check for NaNs.

        Returns
        -------
        scalar, Series, or DataFrame

            The return can be:

            * scalar : when `self` is a Series and `where` is a scalar
            * Series: when `self` is a Series and `where` is an array-like,
              or when `self` is a DataFrame and `where` is a scalar
            * DataFrame : when `self` is a DataFrame and `where` is an
              array-like

        See Also
        --------
        merge_asof : Perform an asof merge. Similar to left join.

        Notes
        -----
        Dates are assumed to be sorted. Raises if this is not the case.

        Examples
        --------
        A Series and a scalar `where`.

        >>> s = pd.Series([1, 2, np.nan, 4], index=[10, 20, 30, 40])
        >>> s
        10    1.0
        20    2.0
        30    NaN
        40    4.0
        dtype: float64

        >>> s.asof(20)
        2.0

        For a sequence `where`, a Series is returned. The first value is
        NaN, because the first element of `where` is before the first
        index value.

        >>> s.asof([5, 20])
        5     NaN
        20    2.0
        dtype: float64

        Missing values are not considered. The following is ``2.0``, not
        NaN, even though NaN is at the index location for ``30``.

        >>> s.asof(30)
        2.0

        Take all columns into consideration

        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [10., 20., 30., 40., 50.],
        ...                    'b': [None, None, None, None, 500]},

        Detect missing values.

        Return a boolean same-sized object indicating if the values are NA.
        NA values, such as None or :attr:`numpy.NaN`, gets mapped to True
        values.
        Everything else gets mapped to False values. Characters such as empty
        strings ``''`` or :attr:`numpy.inf` are not considered NA values
        (unless you set ``pandas.options.mode.use_inf_as_na = True``).

        Returns
        -------
        {klass}
            Mask of bool values for each element in {klass} that
            indicates whether an element is an NA value.

        See Also
        --------
        {klass}.isnull : Alias of isna.
        {klass}.notna : Boolean inverse of isna.
        {klass}.dropna : Omit axes labels with missing values.
        isna : Top-level isna.

        Trim values at input threshold(s).

        Assigns values outside boundary to boundary values. Thresholds
        can be singular values or array like, and in the latter case
        the clipping is performed element-wise in the specified axis.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lower : float or array-like, default None
            Minimum threshold value. All values below this
            threshold will be set to it. A missing
            threshold (e.g `NA`) will not clip the value.
        upper : float or array-like, default None
            Maximum threshold value. All values above this
            threshold will be set to it. A missing
            threshold (e.g `NA`) will not clip the value.
        axis : {{0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns', None}}, default None
            Align object with lower and upper along the given axis.
            For `Series` this parameter is unused and defaults to `None`.
        inplace : bool, default False
            Whether to perform the operation in place on the data.
        *args, **kwargs
            Additional keywords have no effect but might be accepted
            for compatibility with numpy.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame or None
            Same type as calling object with the values outside the
            clip boundaries replaced or None if ``inplace=True``.

        See Also
        --------
        Series.clip : Trim values at input threshold in series.
        DataFrame.clip : Trim values at input threshold in dataframe.
        numpy.clip : Clip (limit) the values in an array.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> data = {'col_0': [9, -3, 0, -1, 5], 'col_1': [-2, -7, 6, 8, -5]}
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data)

        3     -1      8
        4      5     -5

        Clips per column using lower and upper thresholds:

        >>> df.clip(-4, 6)
           col_0  col_1
        0      6     -2
        1     -3     -4
        2      0      6
        3     -1      6
        4      5     -4

        Clips using specific lower and upper thresholds per column:

        >>> df.clip([-2, -1], [4, 5])
            col_0  col_1
        0      4     -1
        1     -2     -1

        3     -1      5
        4      4     -1

        Clips using specific lower and upper thresholds per column element:

        >>> t = pd.Series([2, -4, -1, 6, 3])
        >>> t
        0    2
        1   -4

        2      0      3
        3      6      8
        4      5      3

        Clips using specific lower threshold per column element, with missing values:

        >>> t = pd.Series([2, -4, np.nan, 6, 3])
        >>> t
        0    2.0
        1   -4.0

        Convert time series to specified frequency.

        Returns the original data conformed to a new index with the specified
        frequency.

        If the index of this {klass} is a :class:`~pandas.PeriodIndex`, the new index
        is the result of transforming the original index with
        :meth:`PeriodIndex.asfreq <pandas.PeriodIndex.asfreq>` (so the original index
        will map one-to-one to the new index).

        Otherwise, the new index will be equivalent to ``pd.date_range(start, end,
        freq=freq)`` where ``start`` and ``end`` are, respectively, the first and
        last entries in the original index (see :func:`pandas.date_range`). The
        values corresponding to any timesteps in the new index which were not present
        in the original index will be null (``NaN``), unless a method for filling
        such unknowns is provided (see the ``method`` parameter below).

        The :meth:`resample` method is more appropriate if an operation on each group of
        timesteps (such as an aggregate) is necessary to represent the data at the new
        frequency.

        Parameters
        ----------
        freq : DateOffset or str
            Frequency DateOffset or string.
        method : {{'backfill'/'bfill', 'pad'/'ffill'}}, default None
            Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series (note this
            does not fill NaNs that already were present):

            * 'pad' / 'ffill': propagate last valid observation forward to next
              valid
            * 'backfill' / 'bfill': use NEXT valid observation to fill.
        how : {{'start', 'end'}}, default end
            For PeriodIndex only (see PeriodIndex.asfreq).
        normalize : bool, default False
            Whether to reset output index to midnight.
        fill_value : scalar, optional
            Value to use for missing values, applied during upsampling (note
            this does not fill NaNs that already were present).

        Returns
        -------
        {klass}
            {klass} object reindexed to the specified frequency.

        See Also
        --------
        reindex : Conform DataFrame to new index with optional filling logic.

        Notes
        -----
        To learn more about the frequency strings, please see `this link
        <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases>`__.

        Examples
        --------
        Start by creating a series with 4 one minute timestamps.

        >>> index = pd.date_range('1/1/2000', periods=4, freq='min')
        >>> series = pd.Series([0.0, None, 2.0, 3.0], index=index)
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({{'s': series}})
        >>> df
                               s
        2000-01-01 00:00:00    0.0
        2000-01-01 00:01:00    NaN
        2000-01-01 00:02:00    2.0
        2000-01-01 00:03:00    3.0

        Upsample the series into 30 second bins.

        >>> df.asfreq(freq='30s')
                               s
        2000-01-01 00:00:00    0.0
        2000-01-01 00:00:30    NaN
        2000-01-01 00:01:00    NaN
        2000-01-01 00:01:30    NaN
        2000-01-01 00:02:00    2.0
        2000-01-01 00:02:30    NaN
        2000-01-01 00:03:00    3.0

        Upsample again, providing a ``fill value``.

        >>> df.asfreq(freq='30s', fill_value=9.0)
                               s
        2000-01-01 00:00:00    0.0
        2000-01-01 00:00:30    9.0
        2000-01-01 00:01:00    NaN
        2000-01-01 00:01:30    9.0

        2000-01-01 00:02:30    9.0
        2000-01-01 00:03:00    3.0

        Upsample again, providing a ``method``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        start_time : datetime.time or str
            Initial time as a time filter limit.
        end_time : datetime.time or str
            End time as a time filter limit.
        inclusive : {"both", "neither", "left", "right"}, default "both"
            Include boundaries; whether to set each bound as closed or open.
        axis : {0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns'}, default 0
            Determine range time on index or columns value.
            For `Series` this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame
            Data from the original object filtered to the specified dates range.

        Raises
        ------

        Resample time-series data.

        Convenience method for frequency conversion and resampling of time series.
        The object must have a datetime-like index (`DatetimeIndex`, `PeriodIndex`,
        or `TimedeltaIndex`), or the caller must pass the label of a datetime-like
        series/index to the ``on``/``level`` keyword parameter.

        Parameters
        ----------
        rule : DateOffset, Timedelta or str
            The offset string or object representing target conversion.
        axis : {{0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns'}}, default 0
            Which axis to use for up- or down-sampling. For `Series` this parameter
            is unused and defaults to 0. Must be
            `DatetimeIndex`, `TimedeltaIndex` or `PeriodIndex`.

            .. deprecated:: 2.0.0
                Use frame.T.resample(...) instead.
        closed : {{'right', 'left'}}, default None
            Which side of bin interval is closed. The default is 'left'
            for all frequency offsets except for 'ME', 'YE', 'QE', 'BME',
            'BA', 'BQE', and 'W' which all have a default of 'right'.
        label : {{'right', 'left'}}, default None
            Which bin edge label to label bucket with. The default is 'left'
            for all frequency offsets except for 'ME', 'YE', 'QE', 'BME',
            'BA', 'BQE', and 'W' which all have a default of 'right'.
        convention : {{'start', 'end', 's', 'e'}}, default 'start'
            For `PeriodIndex` only, controls whether to use the start or
            end of `rule`.

        kind : {{'timestamp', 'period'}}, optional, default None
            Pass 'timestamp' to convert the resulting index to a
            `DateTimeIndex` or 'period' to convert it to a `PeriodIndex`.
            By default the input representation is retained.

            .. deprecated:: 2.2.0
                Convert index to desired type explicitly instead.

        on : str, optional
            For a DataFrame, column to use instead of index for resampling.
            Column must be datetime-like.
        level : str or int, optional
            For a MultiIndex, level (name or number) to use for
            resampling. `level` must be datetime-like.
        origin : Timestamp or str, default 'start_day'
            The timestamp on which to adjust the grouping. The timezone of origin
            must match the timezone of the index.
            If string, must be one of the following:

            - 'epoch': `origin` is 1970-01-01
            - 'start': `origin` is the first value of the timeseries
            - 'start_day': `origin` is the first day at midnight of the timeseries

            - 'end': `origin` is the last value of the timeseries
            - 'end_day': `origin` is the ceiling midnight of the last day

            .. versionadded:: 1.3.0

            .. note::

                Only takes effect for Tick-frequencies (i.e. fixed frequencies like
                days, hours, and minutes, rather than months or quarters).
        offset : Timedelta or str, default is None
            An offset timedelta added to the origin.

        group_keys : bool, default False
            Whether to include the group keys in the result index when using
            ``.apply()`` on the resampled object.

            .. versionadded:: 1.5.0

                Not specifying ``group_keys`` will retain values-dependent behavior
                from pandas 1.4 and earlier (see :ref:`pandas 1.5.0 Release notes
                <whatsnew_150.enhancements.resample_group_keys>` for examples).

            .. versionchanged:: 2.0.0

                ``group_keys`` now defaults to ``False``.

        Returns
        -------
        pandas.api.typing.Resampler
            :class:`~pandas.core.Resampler` object.

        groupby : Group {klass} by mapping, function, label, or list of labels.
        asfreq : Reindex a {klass} with the given frequency without grouping.

        Notes
        -----
        See the `user guide

        Examples
        --------
        Start by creating a series with 9 one minute timestamps.

        >>> index = pd.date_range('1/1/2000', periods=9, freq='min')
        >>> series = pd.Series(range(9), index=index)
        >>> series
        2000-01-01 00:00:00    0
        2000-01-01 00:01:00    1
        2000-01-01 00:02:00    2
        2000-01-01 00:03:00    3
        2000-01-01 00:04:00    4
        2000-01-01 00:05:00    5
        2000-01-01 00:06:00    6
        2000-01-01 00:07:00    7
        2000-01-01 00:08:00    8
        Freq: min, dtype: int64

        Downsample the series into 3 minute bins and sum the values
        of the timestamps falling into a bin.

        >>> series.resample('3min').sum()
        2000-01-01 00:00:00     3
        2000-01-01 00:03:00    12
        2000-01-01 00:06:00    21
        Freq: 3min, dtype: int64

        Downsample the series into 3 minute bins as above, but label each
        bin using the right edge instead of the left. Please note that the
        value in the bucket used as the label is not included in the bucket,
        which it labels. For example, in the original series the
        bucket ``2000-01-01 00:03:00`` contains the value 3, but the summed
        value in the resampled bucket with the label ``2000-01-01 00:03:00``
        does not include 3 (if it did, the summed value would be 6, not 3).

        >>> series.resample('3min', label='right').sum()
        2000-01-01 00:03:00     3
        2000-01-01 00:06:00    12
        2000-01-01 00:09:00    21
        Freq: 3min, dtype: int64

        To include this value close the right side of the bin interval,
        as shown below.

        >>> series.resample('3min', label='right', closed='right').sum()
        2000-01-01 00:00:00     0
        2000-01-01 00:03:00     6
        2000-01-01 00:06:00    15
        2000-01-01 00:09:00    15
        Freq: 3min, dtype: int64

        Upsample the series into 30 second bins.

        >>> series.resample('30s').asfreq()[0:5]   # Select first 5 rows
        2000-01-01 00:00:00   0.0
        2000-01-01 00:00:30   NaN
        2000-01-01 00:01:00   1.0
        2000-01-01 00:01:30   NaN
        2000-01-01 00:02:00   2.0
        Freq: 30s, dtype: float64

        Upsample the series into 30 second bins and fill the ``NaN``
        values using the ``ffill`` method.

        >>> series.resample('30s').ffill()[0:5]
        2000-01-01 00:00:00    0
        2000-01-01 00:00:30    0
        2000-01-01 00:01:00    1
        2000-01-01 00:01:30    1
        2000-01-01 00:02:00    2
        Freq: 30s, dtype: int64

        Upsample the series into 30 second bins and fill the
        ``NaN`` values using the ``bfill`` method.

        >>> series.resample('30s').bfill()[0:5]
        2000-01-01 00:00:00    0
        2000-01-01 00:00:30    1
        2000-01-01 00:01:00    1
        2000-01-01 00:01:30    2
        2000-01-01 00:02:00    2
        Freq: 30s, dtype: int64

        Pass a custom function via ``apply``

        >>> def custom_resampler(arraylike):
        ...     return np.sum(arraylike) + 5
        ...
        >>> series.resample('3min').apply(custom_resampler)
        2000-01-01 00:00:00     8
        2000-01-01 00:03:00    17
        2000-01-01 00:06:00    26
        Freq: 3min, dtype: int64

        For a Series with a PeriodIndex, the keyword `convention` can be
        used to control whether to use the start or end of `rule`.

        Resample a year by quarter using 'start' `convention`. Values are

        For DataFrame objects, the keyword `on` can be used to specify the
        column instead of the index for resampling.

        >>> d = {{'price': [10, 11, 9, 13, 14, 18, 17, 19],
        ...      'volume': [50, 60, 40, 100, 50, 100, 40, 50]}}
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(d)
        >>> df['week_starting'] = pd.date_range('01/01/2018',
        ...                                     periods=8,
        ...                                     freq='W')
        >>> df

        7     19      50    2018-02-25
        >>> df.resample('ME', on='week_starting').mean()

        For a DataFrame with MultiIndex, the keyword `level` can be used to
        specify on which level the resampling needs to take place.

        >>> days = pd.date_range('1/1/2000', periods=4, freq='D')
        >>> d2 = {{'price': [10, 11, 9, 13, 14, 18, 17, 19],
        ...       'volume': [50, 60, 40, 100, 50, 100, 40, 50]}}
        >>> df2 = pd.DataFrame(
        ...     d2,
        ...     index=pd.MultiIndex.from_product(
        ...         [days, ['morning', 'afternoon']]
        ...     )
        ... )

        2000-01-04 morning       17      40
                   afternoon     19      50
        >>> df2.resample('D', level=0).sum()
                    price  volume
        2000-01-01     21     110

        If you want to adjust the start of the bins based on a fixed timestamp:

        >>> start, end = '2000-10-01 23:30:00', '2000-10-02 00:30:00'
        >>> rng = pd.date_range(start, end, freq='7min')
        >>> ts = pd.Series(np.arange(len(rng)) * 3, index=rng)
        >>> ts
        2000-10-01 23:30:00     0
        2000-10-01 23:37:00     3

        >>> ts.resample('17min').sum()

        2000-10-02 00:09:00    39
        2000-10-02 00:26:00    24
        Freq: 17min, dtype: int64

        >>> ts.resample('17min', origin='2000-01-01').sum()
        2000-10-01 23:24:00     3

        2000-10-02 00:15:00    45
        Freq: 17min, dtype: int64

        If you want to adjust the start of the bins with an `offset` Timedelta, the two
        following lines are equivalent:

        >>> ts.resample('17min', origin='start').sum()
        2000-10-01 23:30:00     9
        2000-10-01 23:47:00    21
        2000-10-02 00:04:00    54
        2000-10-02 00:21:00    24
        Freq: 17min, dtype: int64

        >>> ts.resample('17min', offset='23h30min').sum()
        2000-10-01 23:30:00     9
        2000-10-01 23:47:00    21
        2000-10-02 00:04:00    54
        2000-10-02 00:21:00    24
        Freq: 17min, dtype: int64

        If you want to take the largest Timestamp as the end of the bins:

        >>> ts.resample('17min', origin='end').sum()
        2000-10-01 23:35:00     0
        2000-10-01 23:52:00    18
        2000-10-02 00:09:00    27
        2000-10-02 00:26:00    63
        Freq: 17min, dtype: int64

        In contrast with the `start_day`, you can use `end_day` to take the ceiling
        midnight of the largest Timestamp as the end of the bins and drop the bins
        not containing data:

        >>> ts.resample('17min', origin='end_day').sum()
        2000-10-01 23:38:00     3
        2000-10-01 23:55:00    15
        2000-10-02 00:12:00    45
        2000-10-02 00:29:00    45

        Select initial periods of time series data based on a date offset.

        .. deprecated:: 2.1
            :meth:`.first` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
            Please create a mask and filter using `.loc` instead.

        For a DataFrame with a sorted DatetimeIndex, this function can
        select the first few rows based on a date offset.

        Parameters
        ----------
        offset : str, DateOffset or dateutil.relativedelta
            The offset length of the data that will be selected. For instance,
            '1ME' will display all the rows having their index within the first month.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame
            A subset of the caller.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If the index is not  a :class:`DatetimeIndex`

        See Also
        --------
        last : Select final periods of time series based on a date offset.
        at_time : Select values at a particular time of the day.
        between_time : Select values between particular times of the day.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> i = pd.date_range('2018-04-09', periods=4, freq='2D')
        >>> ts = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3, 4]}, index=i)
        >>> ts

        2018-04-13  3
        2018-04-15  4

        Get the rows for the first 3 days:

        >>> ts.first('3D')
                    A
        2018-04-09  1
        2018-04-11  2

        Notice the data for 3 first calendar days were returned, not the first
        3 days observed in the dataset, and therefore data for 2018-04-13 was
        not returned.

        Compute numerical data ranks (1 through n) along axis.

        By default, equal values are assigned a rank that is the average of the
        ranks of those values.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : {0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns'}, default 0
            Index to direct ranking.
            For `Series` this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.
        method : {'average', 'min', 'max', 'first', 'dense'}, default 'average'
            How to rank the group of records that have the same value (i.e. ties):

            * average: average rank of the group
            * min: lowest rank in the group
            * max: highest rank in the group
            * first: ranks assigned in order they appear in the array
            * dense: like 'min', but rank always increases by 1 between groups.

        numeric_only : bool, default False
            For DataFrame objects, rank only numeric columns if set to True.

            .. versionchanged:: 2.0.0
                The default value of ``numeric_only`` is now ``False``.

        na_option : {'keep', 'top', 'bottom'}, default 'keep'
            How to rank NaN values:

            * keep: assign NaN rank to NaN values
            * top: assign lowest rank to NaN values
            * bottom: assign highest rank to NaN values

        ascending : bool, default True
            Whether or not the elements should be ranked in ascending order.
        pct : bool, default False
            Whether or not to display the returned rankings in percentile
            form.

        Returns
        -------
        same type as caller
            Return a Series or DataFrame with data ranks as values.

        See Also
        --------
        core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.rank : Rank of values within each group.
        core.groupby.SeriesGroupBy.rank : Rank of values within each group.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data={'Animal': ['cat', 'penguin', 'dog',
        ...                                    'spider', 'snake'],
        ...                         'Number_legs': [4, 2, 4, 8, np.nan]})
        >>> df
            Animal  Number_legs
        0      cat          4.0
        1  penguin          2.0
        2      dog          4.0
        3   spider          8.0
        4    snake          NaN

        Ties are assigned the mean of the ranks (by default) for the group.

        >>> s = pd.Series(range(5), index=list("abcde"))
        >>> s["d"] = s["b"]
        >>> s.rank()
        a    1.0
        b    2.5
        c    4.0
        d    2.5
        e    5.0
        dtype: float64

        The following example shows how the method behaves with the above
        parameters:

        * default_rank: this is the default behaviour obtained without using
          any parameter.
        * max_rank: setting ``method = 'max'`` the records that have the
          same values are ranked using the highest rank (e.g.: since 'cat'
          and 'dog' are both in the 2nd and 3rd position, rank 3 is assigned.)
        * NA_bottom: choosing ``na_option = 'bottom'``, if there are records
          with NaN values they are placed at the bottom of the ranking.
        * pct_rank: when setting ``pct = True``, the ranking is expressed as
          percentile rank.

        >>> df['default_rank'] = df['Number_legs'].rank()
        >>> df['max_rank'] = df['Number_legs'].rank(method='max')
        >>> df['NA_bottom'] = df['Number_legs'].rank(na_option='bottom')
        >>> df['pct_rank'] = df['Number_legs'].rank(pct=True)
        >>> df
            Animal  Number_legs  default_rank  max_rank  NA_bottom  pct_rank
        0      cat          4.0           2.5       3.0        2.5     0.625

        Align two objects on their axes with the specified join method.

        Join method is specified for each axis Index.

        Parameters
        ----------
        other : DataFrame or Series
        join : {{'outer', 'inner', 'left', 'right'}}, default 'outer'
            Type of alignment to be performed.

            * left: use only keys from left frame, preserve key order.
            * right: use only keys from right frame, preserve key order.
            * outer: use union of keys from both frames, sort keys lexicographically.
            * inner: use intersection of keys from both frames,
              preserve the order of the left keys.

        axis : allowed axis of the other object, default None
            Align on index (0), columns (1), or both (None).
        level : int or level name, default None
            Broadcast across a level, matching Index values on the
            passed MultiIndex level.
        copy : bool, default True
            Always returns new objects. If copy=False and no reindexing is
            required then original objects are returned.

            .. note::
                The `copy` keyword will change behavior in pandas 3.0.
                `Copy-on-Write
                <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/user_guide/copy_on_write.html>`__
                will be enabled by default, which means that all methods with a
                `copy` keyword will use a lazy copy mechanism to defer the copy and
                ignore the `copy` keyword. The `copy` keyword will be removed in a
                future version of pandas.

                You can already get the future behavior and improvements through
                enabling copy on write ``pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = True``
        fill_value : scalar, default np.nan
            Value to use for missing values. Defaults to NaN, but can be any
            "compatible" value.
        method : {{'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}}, default None
            Method to use for filling holes in reindexed Series:

            - pad / ffill: propagate last valid observation forward to next valid.
            - backfill / bfill: use NEXT valid observation to fill gap.

            .. deprecated:: 2.1

        limit : int, default None
            If method is specified, this is the maximum number of consecutive
            NaN values to forward/backward fill. In other words, if there is
            a gap with more than this number of consecutive NaNs, it will only
            be partially filled. If method is not specified, this is the
            maximum number of entries along the entire axis where NaNs will be
            filled. Must be greater than 0 if not None.

            .. deprecated:: 2.1

        fill_axis : {axes_single_arg}, default 0
            Filling axis, method and limit.

            .. deprecated:: 2.1

        broadcast_axis : {axes_single_arg}, default None
            Broadcast values along this axis, if aligning two objects of
            different dimensions.

            .. deprecated:: 2.1

        Returns
        -------
        tuple of ({klass}, type of other)
            Aligned objects.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(
        ...     [[1, 2, 3, 4], [6, 7, 8, 9]], columns=["D", "B", "E", "A"], index=[1, 2]
        ... )
        >>> other = pd.DataFrame(
        ...     [[10, 20, 30, 40], [60, 70, 80, 90], [600, 700, 800, 900]],
        ...     columns=["A", "B", "C", "D"],
        ...     index=[2, 3, 4],
        ... )
        >>> df
           D  B  E  A
        1  1  2  3  4
        2  6  7  8  9
        >>> other
            A    B    C    D
        2   10   20   30   40
        3   60   70   80   90
        4  600  700  800  900

        Align on columns:

        >>> left, right = df.align(other, join="outer", axis=1)
        >>> left
           A  B   C  D  E
        1  4  2 NaN  1  3
        2  9  7 NaN  6  8
        >>> right
            A    B    C    D   E
        2   10   20   30   40 NaN
        3   60   70   80   90 NaN
        4  600  700  800  900 NaN

        We can also align on the index:

        >>> left, right = df.align(other, join="outer", axis=0)
        >>> left
            D    B    E    A
        1  1.0  2.0  3.0  4.0
        2  6.0  7.0  8.0  9.0
        3  NaN  NaN  NaN  NaN
        4  NaN  NaN  NaN  NaN
        >>> right
            A      B      C      D
        1    NaN    NaN    NaN    NaN
        2   10.0   20.0   30.0   40.0
        3   60.0   70.0   80.0   90.0
        4  600.0  700.0  800.0  900.0

        Finally, the default `axis=None` will align on both index and columns:

        >>> left, right = df.align(other, join="outer", axis=None)
        >>> left
             A    B   C    D    E
        1  4.0  2.0 NaN  1.0  3.0
        2  9.0  7.0 NaN  6.0  8.0
        3  NaN  NaN NaN  NaN  NaN
        4  NaN  NaN NaN  NaN  NaN
        >>> right
               A      B      C      D   E
        1    NaN    NaN    NaN    NaN NaN
        2   10.0   20.0   30.0   40.0 NaN
        3   60.0   70.0   80.0   90.0 NaN
        4  600.0  700.0  800.0  900.0 NaN

        Replace values where the condition is {cond_rev}.

        Parameters
        ----------
        cond : bool {klass}, array-like, or callable
            Where `cond` is {cond}, keep the original value. Where
            {cond_rev}, replace with corresponding value from `other`.
            If `cond` is callable, it is computed on the {klass} and
            should return boolean {klass} or array. The callable must
            not change input {klass} (though pandas doesn't check it).
        other : scalar, {klass}, or callable
            Entries where `cond` is {cond_rev} are replaced with
            corresponding value from `other`.
            If other is callable, it is computed on the {klass} and
            should return scalar or {klass}. The callable must not
            change input {klass} (though pandas doesn't check it).
            If not specified, entries will be filled with the corresponding
            NULL value (``np.nan`` for numpy dtypes, ``pd.NA`` for extension
            dtypes).
        inplace : bool, default False
            Whether to perform the operation in place on the data.
        axis : int, default None
            Alignment axis if needed. For `Series` this parameter is
            unused and defaults to 0.
        level : int, default None
            Alignment level if needed.

        Returns
        -------
        Same type as caller or None if ``inplace=True``.

        See Also
        --------
        :func:`DataFrame.{name_other}` : Return an object of same shape as
            self.

        Notes
        -----
        The {name} method is an application of the if-then idiom. For each
        element in the calling DataFrame, if ``cond`` is ``{cond}`` the
        element is used; otherwise the corresponding element from the DataFrame
        ``other`` is used. If the axis of ``other`` does not align with axis of
        ``cond`` {klass}, the misaligned index positions will be filled with
        {cond_rev}.

        The signature for :func:`DataFrame.where` differs from
        :func:`numpy.where`. Roughly ``df1.where(m, df2)`` is equivalent to
        ``np.where(m, df1, df2)``.

        For further details and examples see the ``{name}`` documentation in
        :ref:`indexing <indexing.where_mask>`.

        The dtype of the object takes precedence. The fill value is casted to
        the object's dtype, if this can be done losslessly.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> s = pd.Series(range(5))
        >>> s.where(s > 0)

        Shift index by desired number of periods with an optional time `freq`.

        When `freq` is not passed, shift the index without realigning the data.
        If `freq` is passed (in this case, the index must be date or datetime,
        or it will raise a `NotImplementedError`), the index will be
        increased using the periods and the `freq`. `freq` can be inferred
        when specified as "infer" as long as either freq or inferred_freq
        attribute is set in the index.

        Parameters
        ----------
        periods : int or Sequence
            Number of periods to shift. Can be positive or negative.
            If an iterable of ints, the data will be shifted once by each int.
            This is equivalent to shifting by one value at a time and
            concatenating all resulting frames. The resulting columns will have
            the shift suffixed to their column names. For multiple periods,
            axis must not be 1.
        freq : DateOffset, tseries.offsets, timedelta, or str, optional
            Offset to use from the tseries module or time rule (e.g. 'EOM').
            If `freq` is specified then the index values are shifted but the
            data is not realigned. That is, use `freq` if you would like to
            extend the index when shifting and preserve the original data.
            If `freq` is specified as "infer" then it will be inferred from
            the freq or inferred_freq attributes of the index. If neither of
            those attributes exist, a ValueError is thrown.
        axis : {{0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns', None}}, default None
            Shift direction. For `Series` this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.
        fill_value : object, optional
            The scalar value to use for newly introduced missing values.
            the default depends on the dtype of `self`.
            For numeric data, ``np.nan`` is used.
            For datetime, timedelta, or period data, etc. :attr:`NaT` is used.
            For extension dtypes, ``self.dtype.na_value`` is used.
        suffix : str, optional
            If str and periods is an iterable, this is added after the column
            name and before the shift value for each shifted column name.

        Returns
        -------
        {klass}
            Copy of input object, shifted.

        See Also
        --------
        Index.shift : Shift values of Index.
        DatetimeIndex.shift : Shift values of DatetimeIndex.
        PeriodIndex.shift : Shift values of PeriodIndex.

        Truncate a Series or DataFrame before and after some index value.

        This is a useful shorthand for boolean indexing based on index
        values above or below certain thresholds.

        Parameters
        ----------
        before : date, str, int
            Truncate all rows before this index value.
        after : date, str, int
            Truncate all rows after this index value.
        axis : {0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns'}, optional
            Axis to truncate. Truncates the index (rows) by default.
            For `Series` this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.
        copy : bool, default is True,
            Return a copy of the truncated section.

            .. note::
                The `copy` keyword will change behavior in pandas 3.0.
                `Copy-on-Write

                will be enabled by default, which means that all methods with a
                `copy` keyword will use a lazy copy mechanism to defer the copy and
                ignore the `copy` keyword. The `copy` keyword will be removed in a
                future version of pandas.

                You can already get the future behavior and improvements through
                enabling copy on write ``pd.options.mode.copy_on_write = True``

        Notes
        -----
        If the index being truncated contains only datetime values,
        `before` and `after` may be specified as strings instead of
        Timestamps.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
        ...                    'B': ['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'],
        ...                    'C': ['k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o']},
        ...                   index=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        >>> df
           A  B  C

        2  b  g  l
        3  c  h  m
        4  d  i  n
        5  e  j  o

        >>> df.truncate(before=2, after=4)
           A  B  C
        2  b  g  l
        3  c  h  m
        4  d  i  n

        The columns of a DataFrame can be truncated.

        >>> df.truncate(before="A", after="B", axis="columns")
           A  B
        1  a  f
        2  b  g
        3  c  h
        4  d  i
        5  e  j

        For Series, only rows can be truncated.

        >>> df['A'].truncate(before=2, after=4)
        2    b
        3    c
        4    d
        Name: A, dtype: object

        The index values in ``truncate`` can be datetimes or string
        dates.

        >>> dates = pd.date_range('2016-01-01', '2016-02-01', freq='s')
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame(index=dates, data={'A': 1})
        >>> df.tail()
                             A
        2016-01-31 23:59:56  1
        2016-01-31 23:59:57  1
        2016-01-31 23:59:58  1
        2016-01-31 23:59:59  1
        2016-02-01 00:00:00  1

        >>> df.truncate(before=pd.Timestamp('2016-01-05'),
        ...             after=pd.Timestamp('2016-01-10')).tail()
                             A
        2016-01-09 23:59:56  1
        2016-01-09 23:59:57  1
        2016-01-09 23:59:58  1
        2016-01-09 23:59:59  1
        2016-01-10 00:00:00  1

        Because the index is a DatetimeIndex containing only dates, we can
        specify `before` and `after` as strings. They will be coerced to
        Timestamps before truncation.

        >>> df.truncate('2016-01-05', '2016-01-10').tail()
                             A
        2016-01-09 23:59:56  1
        2016-01-09 23:59:57  1
        2016-01-09 23:59:58  1
        2016-01-09 23:59:59  1
        2016-01-10 00:00:00  1

        Note that ``truncate`` assumes a 0 value for any unspecified time
        component (midnight). This differs from partial string slicing, which
        returns any partially matching dates.

        >>> df.loc['2016-01-05':'2016-01-10', :].tail()
                             A

        Parameters
        ----------
        tz : str or tzinfo object or None
            Target time zone. Passing ``None`` will convert to
            UTC and remove the timezone information.
        axis : {{0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns'}}, default 0
            The axis to convert
        level : int, str, default None
            If axis is a MultiIndex, convert a specific level. Otherwise
            must be None.
        copy : bool, default True
            Also make a copy of the underlying data.

            .. note::
                The `copy` keyword will change behavior in pandas 3.0.

        Localize tz-naive index of a Series or DataFrame to target time zone.

        This operation localizes the Index. To localize the values in a
        timezone-naive Series, use :meth:`Series.dt.tz_localize`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tz : str or tzinfo or None
            Time zone to localize. Passing ``None`` will remove the
            time zone information and preserve local time.
        axis : {{0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns'}}, default 0
            The axis to localize
        level : int, str, default None
            If axis ia a MultiIndex, localize a specific level. Otherwise
            must be None.
        copy : bool, default True
            Also make a copy of the underlying data.

            .. note::
                The `copy` keyword will change behavior in pandas 3.0.

                will be enabled by default, which means that all methods with a

        ambiguous : 'infer', bool-ndarray, 'NaT', default 'raise'
            When clocks moved backward due to DST, ambiguous times may arise.
            For example in Central European Time (UTC+01), when going from
            03:00 DST to 02:00 non-DST, 02:30:00 local time occurs both at
            00:30:00 UTC and at 01:30:00 UTC. In such a situation, the
            `ambiguous` parameter dictates how ambiguous times should be
            handled.

            - 'infer' will attempt to infer fall dst-transition hours based on
              order
            - bool-ndarray where True signifies a DST time, False designates
              a non-DST time (note that this flag is only applicable for
              ambiguous times)
            - 'NaT' will return NaT where there are ambiguous times
            - 'raise' will raise an AmbiguousTimeError if there are ambiguous
              times.
        nonexistent : str, default 'raise'
            A nonexistent time does not exist in a particular timezone
            where clocks moved forward due to DST. Valid values are:

            - 'shift_forward' will shift the nonexistent time forward to the
              closest existing time
            - 'shift_backward' will shift the nonexistent time backward to the
              closest existing time
            - 'NaT' will return NaT where there are nonexistent times
            - timedelta objects will shift nonexistent times by the timedelta
            - 'raise' will raise an NonExistentTimeError if there are
              nonexistent times.

        Returns
        -------
        {klass}
            Same type as the input.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If the TimeSeries is tz-aware and tz is not None.

        Examples
        --------
        Localize local times:

        >>> s = pd.Series(
        ...     [1],
        ...     index=pd.DatetimeIndex(['2018-09-15 01:30:00']),
        ... )
        >>> s.tz_localize('CET')
        2018-09-15 01:30:00+02:00    1
        dtype: int64

        Pass None to convert to tz-naive index and preserve local time:

        >>> s = pd.Series([1],
        ...               index=pd.DatetimeIndex(['2018-09-15 01:30:00+02:00']))
        >>> s.tz_localize(None)
        2018-09-15 01:30:00    1
        dtype: int64

        Be careful with DST changes. When there is sequential data, pandas
        can infer the DST time:

        >>> s = pd.Series(range(7),
        ...               index=pd.DatetimeIndex(['2018-10-28 01:30:00',
        ...                                       '2018-10-28 02:00:00',

        In some cases, inferring the DST is impossible. In such cases, you can
        pass an ndarray to the ambiguous parameter to set the DST explicitly

        >>> s = pd.Series(range(3),
        ...               index=pd.DatetimeIndex(['2018-10-28 01:20:00',
        ...                                       '2018-10-28 02:36:00',
        ...                                       '2018-10-28 03:46:00']))
        >>> s.tz_localize('CET', ambiguous=np.array([True, True, False]))

        If the DST transition causes nonexistent times, you can shift these
        dates forward or backward with a timedelta object or `'shift_forward'`
        or `'shift_backward'`.

        Generate descriptive statistics.

        Descriptive statistics include those that summarize the central
        tendency, dispersion and shape of a
        dataset's distribution, excluding ``NaN`` values.

        Analyzes both numeric and object series, as well
        as ``DataFrame`` column sets of mixed data types. The output
        will vary depending on what is provided. Refer to the notes
        below for more detail.

        Parameters
        ----------
        percentiles : list-like of numbers, optional
            The percentiles to include in the output. All should
            fall between 0 and 1. The default is
            ``[.25, .5, .75]``, which returns the 25th, 50th, and
            75th percentiles.
        include : 'all', list-like of dtypes or None (default), optional
            A white list of data types to include in the result. Ignored
            for ``Series``. Here are the options:

            - 'all' : All columns of the input will be included in the output.
            - A list-like of dtypes : Limits the results to the
              provided data types.
              To limit the result to numeric types submit
              ``numpy.number``. To limit it instead to object columns submit
              the ``numpy.object`` data type. Strings
              can also be used in the style of
              ``select_dtypes`` (e.g. ``df.describe(include=['O'])``). To
              select pandas categorical columns, use ``'category'``
            - None (default) : The result will include all numeric columns.
        exclude : list-like of dtypes or None (default), optional,
            A black list of data types to omit from the result. Ignored
            for ``Series``. Here are the options:

            - A list-like of dtypes : Excludes the provided data types
              from the result. To exclude numeric types submit
              ``numpy.number``. To exclude object columns submit the data
              type ``numpy.object``. Strings can also be used in the style of
              ``select_dtypes`` (e.g. ``df.describe(exclude=['O'])``). To
              exclude pandas categorical columns, use ``'category'``
            - None (default) : The result will exclude nothing.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame
            Summary statistics of the Series or Dataframe provided.

        See Also
        --------
        DataFrame.count: Count number of non-NA/null observations.
        DataFrame.max: Maximum of the values in the object.
        DataFrame.min: Minimum of the values in the object.
        DataFrame.mean: Mean of the values.
        DataFrame.std: Standard deviation of the observations.
        DataFrame.select_dtypes: Subset of a DataFrame including/excluding
            columns based on their dtype.

        Notes
        -----
        For numeric data, the result's index will include ``count``,
        ``mean``, ``std``, ``min``, ``max`` as well as lower, ``50`` and
        upper percentiles. By default the lower percentile is ``25`` and the
        upper percentile is ``75``. The ``50`` percentile is the
        same as the median.

        For object data (e.g. strings or timestamps), the result's index
        will include ``count``, ``unique``, ``top``, and ``freq``. The ``top``
        is the most common value. The ``freq`` is the most common value's
        frequency. Timestamps also include the ``first`` and ``last`` items.

        If multiple object values have the highest count, then the
        ``count`` and ``top`` results will be arbitrarily chosen from
        among those with the highest count.

        For mixed data types provided via a ``DataFrame``, the default is to
        return only an analysis of numeric columns. If the dataframe consists
        only of object and categorical data without any numeric columns, the
        default is to return an analysis of both the object and categorical
        columns. If ``include='all'`` is provided as an option, the result
        will include a union of attributes of each type.

        The `include` and `exclude` parameters can be used to limit
        which columns in a ``DataFrame`` are analyzed for the output.
        The parameters are ignored when analyzing a ``Series``.

        Fractional change between the current and a prior element.

        Computes the fractional change from the immediately previous row by
        default. This is useful in comparing the fraction of change in a time
        series of elements.

        .. note::

            Despite the name of this method, it calculates fractional change
            (also known as per unit change or relative change) and not
            percentage change. If you need the percentage change, multiply
            these values by 100.

        Parameters
        ----------
        periods : int, default 1
            Periods to shift for forming percent change.
        fill_method : {'backfill', 'bfill', 'pad', 'ffill', None}, default 'pad'
            How to handle NAs **before** computing percent changes.

                All options of `fill_method` are deprecated except `fill_method=None`.

        limit : int, default None
            The number of consecutive NAs to fill before stopping.

            .. deprecated:: 2.1

        freq : DateOffset, timedelta, or str, optional
            Increment to use from time series API (e.g. 'ME' or BDay()).
        **kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments are passed into
            `DataFrame.shift` or `Series.shift`.

        Returns
        -------
        Series or DataFrame
            The same type as the calling object.

        See Also
        --------
        Series.diff : Compute the difference of two elements in a Series.
        DataFrame.diff : Compute the difference of two elements in a DataFrame.
        Series.shift : Shift the index by some number of periods.
        DataFrame.shift : Shift the index by some number of periods.

        Examples
        --------
        **Series**

        >>> s = pd.Series([90, 91, 85])
        >>> s
        0    90
        1    91
        2    85

        1    0.011111
        2   -0.065934
        dtype: float64

        >>> s.pct_change(periods=2)
        0         NaN
        1         NaN
        2   -0.055556
        dtype: float64

        See the percentage change in a Series where filling NAs with last
        valid observation forward to next valid.

        >>> s = pd.Series([90, 91, None, 85])
        >>> s
        0    90.0
        1    91.0
        2     NaN
        3    85.0
        dtype: float64

        >>> s.ffill().pct_change()
        0         NaN
        1    0.011111
        2    0.000000

{desc}

Parameters
----------
axis : {axis_descr}
    Axis for the function to be applied on.
    For `Series` this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.

    For DataFrames, specifying ``axis=None`` will apply the aggregation
    across both axes.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

skipna : bool, default True
    Exclude NA/null values when computing the result.
numeric_only : bool, default False
    Include only float, int, boolean columns. Not implemented for Series.

{min_count}**kwargs
    Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the function.

Returns
-------
{name1} or scalar{see_also}{examples}
a  
{desc}

Parameters
----------
axis : {axis_descr}
    Axis for the function to be applied on.
    For `Series` this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.

    .. warning::

        The behavior of DataFrame.{name} with ``axis=None`` is deprecated,
        in a future version this will reduce over both axes and return a scalar
        To retain the old behavior, pass axis=0 (or do not pass axis).

    .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

skipna : bool, default True
    Exclude NA/null values when computing the result.
numeric_only : bool, default False
    Include only float, int, boolean columns. Not implemented for Series.

{min_count}**kwargs
    Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the function.

Returns
-------

Parameters
----------
axis : {axis_descr}
    For `Series` this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.

    .. warning::

        The behavior of DataFrame.{name} with ``axis=None`` is deprecated,
        in a future version this will reduce over both axes and return a scalar
        To retain the old behavior, pass axis=0 (or do not pass axis).

skipna : bool, default True
    Exclude NA/null values. If an entire row/column is NA, the result
    will be NA.
ddof : int, default 1
    Delta Degrees of Freedom. The divisor used in calculations is N - ddof,
    where N represents the number of elements.
numeric_only : bool, default False
    Include only float, int, boolean columns. Not implemented for Series.

Returns
-------
{name1} or {name2} (if level specified) {notes}{examples}
zg

Notes
-----
To have the same behaviour as `numpy.std`, use `ddof=0` (instead of the
default `ddof=1`)ay  

Examples
--------
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'person_id': [0, 1, 2, 3],
...                    'age': [21, 25, 62, 43],
...                    'height': [1.61, 1.87, 1.49, 2.01]}
...                   ).set_index('person_id')
>>> df
           age  height
person_id
0           21    1.61
1           25    1.87
2           62    1.49
3           43    2.01

The standard deviation of the columns can be found as follows:

>>> df.std()
age       18.786076
height     0.237417
dtype: float64

Alternatively, `ddof=0` can be set to normalize by N instead of N-1:

>>> df.std(ddof=0)
age       16.269219
height     0.205609
dtype: float64a?  

Examples
--------
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'person_id': [0, 1, 2, 3],
...                    'age': [21, 25, 62, 43],
...                    'height': [1.61, 1.87, 1.49, 2.01]}
...                   ).set_index('person_id')
>>> df
           age  height
person_id
0           21    1.61
1           25    1.87
2           62    1.49
3           43    2.01

>>> df.var()
age       352.916667
height      0.056367
dtype: float64

Alternatively, ``ddof=0`` can be set to normalize by N instead of N-1:

>>> df.var(ddof=0)
age       264.687500
height      0.042275
dtype: float64aA  
{desc}

Parameters
----------
axis : {{0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns', None}}, default 0
    Indicate which axis or axes should be reduced. For `Series` this parameter
    is unused and defaults to 0.

    * 0 / 'index' : reduce the index, return a Series whose index is the
      original column labels.
    * 1 / 'columns' : reduce the columns, return a Series whose index is the
      original index.
    * None : reduce all axes, return a scalar.

bool_only : bool, default False
    Include only boolean columns. Not implemented for Series.
skipna : bool, default True
    Exclude NA/null values. If the entire row/column is NA and skipna is
    True, then the result will be {empty_value}, as for an empty row/column.
    If skipna is False, then NA are treated as True, because these are not
    equal to zero.
**kwargs : any, default None
    Additional keywords have no effect but might be accepted for
    compatibility with NumPy.

Returns
-------
{name1} or {name2}
    If level is specified, then, {name2} is returned; otherwise, {name1}
    is returned.

{see_also}
{examples}zReturn whether all elements are True, potentially over an axis.

Returns True unless there at least one element within a series or
along a Dataframe axis that is False or equivalent (e.g. zero or
empty).a  Examples
--------
**Series**

>>> pd.Series([True, True]).all()
True
>>> pd.Series([True, False]).all()
False
>>> pd.Series([], dtype="float64").all()
True
>>> pd.Series([np.nan]).all()
True
>>> pd.Series([np.nan]).all(skipna=False)
True

**DataFrames**

Create a dataframe from a dictionary.

>>> df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [True, True], 'col2': [True, False]})
>>> df
   col1   col2
0  True   True
1  True  False

Default behaviour checks if values in each column all return True.

>>> df.all()
col1     True
col2    False
dtype: bool

Specify ``axis='columns'`` to check if values in each row all return True.

>>> df.all(axis='columns')
0     True
1    False
dtype: bool

Or ``axis=None`` for whether every value is True.

>>> df.all(axis=None)
False
zSee Also
--------
Series.all : Return True if all elements are True.
DataFrame.any : Return True if one (or more) elements are True.
aZ  
Return cumulative {desc} over a DataFrame or Series axis.

Returns a DataFrame or Series of the same size containing the cumulative
{desc}.

Parameters
----------
axis : {{0 or 'index', 1 or 'columns'}}, default 0
    The index or the name of the axis. 0 is equivalent to None or 'index'.
    For `Series` this parameter is unused and defaults to 0.
skipna : bool, default True
    Exclude NA/null values. If an entire row/column is NA, the result
    will be NA.
*args, **kwargs
    Additional keywords have no effect but might be accepted for
    compatibility with NumPy.

Returns
-------
{name1} or {name2}
    Return cumulative {desc} of {name1} or {name2}.

See Also
--------
core.window.expanding.Expanding.{accum_func_name} : Similar functionality
    but ignores ``NaN`` values.
{name2}.{accum_func_name} : Return the {desc} over
    {name2} axis.
{name2}.cummax : Return cumulative maximum over {name2} axis.
{name2}.cummin : Return cumulative minimum over {name2} axis.
{name2}.cumsum : Return cumulative sum over {name2} axis.
{name2}.cumprod : Return cumulative product over {name2} axis.

Returns False unless there is at least one element within a series or
along a Dataframe axis that is True or equivalent (e.g. non-zero or
non-empty).a\  Examples
--------
**Series**

For Series input, the output is a scalar indicating whether any element
is True.

>>> pd.Series([False, False]).any()
False
>>> pd.Series([True, False]).any()
True
>>> pd.Series([], dtype="float64").any()
False
>>> pd.Series([np.nan]).any()
False
>>> pd.Series([np.nan]).any(skipna=False)
True

**DataFrame**

Whether each column contains at least one True element (the default).

>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [1, 2], "B": [0, 2], "C": [0, 0]})
>>> df
   A  B  C
0  1  0  0
1  2  2  0

>>> df.any()
A     True
B     True
C    False
dtype: bool

Aggregating over the columns.

>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [True, False], "B": [1, 2]})
>>> df
       A  B
0   True  1
1  False  2

>>> df.any(axis='columns')
0    True
1    True
dtype: bool

>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"A": [True, False], "B": [1, 0]})
>>> df
       A  B
0   True  1
1  False  0

>>> df.any(axis='columns')
0    True
1    False
dtype: bool

Aggregating over the entire DataFrame with ``axis=None``.

>>> df.any(axis=None)
True

`any` for an empty DataFrame is an empty Series.

>>> pd.DataFrame([]).any()
Series([], dtype: bool)

>>> idx = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([
...     ['warm', 'warm', 'cold', 'cold'],

By default, the sum of an empty or all-NA Series is ``0``.

>>> pd.Series([], dtype="float64").sum()  # min_count=0 is the default
0.0

This can be controlled with the ``min_count`` parameter. For example, if
you'd like the sum of an empty series to be NaN, pass ``min_count=1``.

>>> pd.Series([], dtype="float64").sum(min_count=1)
nan

Thanks to the ``skipna`` parameter, ``min_count`` handles all-NA and
empty series identically.

>>> pd.Series([np.nan]).sum()
0.0

>>> pd.Series([np.nan]).sum(min_count=1)
